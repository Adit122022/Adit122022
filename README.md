# Hi, I'm Aditya Sharma

Backend-focused Software Development Engineer with strong foundations in **systems, scalability, and clean architecture**.

I specialize in building **production-grade backend systems** using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis, with React used where frontend integration is required. I care about **performance, reliability, and correctness**, not just making things “work”.

## Core Skills
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, Socket.io, Redis
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL (schema design, indexing, optimization)
- Frontend: React (integration-focused)
- Auth & Security: JWT, OAuth, Role-Based Access Control
- CS Foundations: Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, DBMS
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman, Linux, CI/CD Basics

## Current Focus
- Designing scalable backend services and real-time systems  
- Writing maintainable, testable, and performance-oriented code  
- Deepening system design, caching strategies, and distributed concepts
